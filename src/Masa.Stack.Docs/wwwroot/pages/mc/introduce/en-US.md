# Product Introduction

## What is MASA MC?

`MASA MC` is a comprehensive product that supports message sending in the `MASA Stack 1.0` system collection. It serves as the supporter of the global message system, supporting multi-channel configuration and message sending rules configuration, and can configure various message templates and specific user groups. In addition, it can also be integrated with related products such as `Alert` and `TSC` to provide a one-stop solution for fault problem triggering and handling.

## User Group

Small and medium-sized enterprise IT departments, front-end and back-end developers, and IT operations personnel.

## Product Positioning

In the entire MASA Stack product, MASA MC is an indispensable product. It supports the notification of the entire product and third-party system messages in real demand scenarios. It is the overall configuration platform for global messages.

## Product Goals

MASA MC integrates SMS, email, and in-site messages (currently supported) to access various message channels, with visual preset template configuration, to achieve global message sending and reaching.

## Background of Demand

From the perspective of user use or operation, message reminders are an indispensable part. In a large product matrix, there must be a product that handles various messages separately. From the perspective of usage and application background, a product that configures, sends, and receives global messages is also inevitable. It belongs to supporting tools.

## Product Features and Advantages

1. Multiple message channels of the same type can be configured, as well as multiple message templates corresponding to that type.

2. There are many rules for message sending, and custom sending rules are supported.

3. The message recipient can quickly select a group of recipients through the internal system, or customize the message recipient group. Specific messages support internal and external recipients.

## Practical Scenarios

In the application scenarios of multi-system matrix projects, the message center is an essential product. For example, the user-oriented application software we commonly see will have a so-called personal center and messages. Here, the messages subscribed or received by each person are sent by the corresponding message center. Relatively complex platforms will also coordinate scheduling related products when publishing messages, scheduling the priority of message sending and the queue time of message queues, and have functions such as sending failed messages for re-sending.Version 2.0 will support additional messaging channels and third-party software systems.
