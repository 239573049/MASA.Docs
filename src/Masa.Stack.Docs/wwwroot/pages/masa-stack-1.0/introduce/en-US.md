### 3+4 Product Combination

The so-called 3+4 product combination is a collection of the smallest unit of product matrix, which can be simply understood as the scenario of underlying infrastructure and application.

#### 3 Basic Core Products

[PM](stack/pm/introduce), [Auth](stack/auth/introduce), and [DCC](stack/dcc/introduce) are the core infrastructure products that provide the initial initialization process, a set of processes from project creation to application deployment based on actual projects, and support for multiple environments and multiple cluster relationships. They also provide single sign-on, authentication, and authorization for users. Different environment configurations can be changed and replaced quickly in the DCC center.

#### 4 Related Application Products

[Scheduler](stack/scheduler/introduce), [TSC](stack/tsc/introduce), [Alert](stack/alert/introduce), and [MC](stack/mc/introduce) are a collection of four products that are essential infrastructure products for business. They provide scheduling and retrying of task execution, monitoring of existing projects and applications, setting of related alarm indicators and rules, and triggering and delivering messages through the message center to reduce the possibility of faults. Each product can be used in unique demand scenarios to provide services for enterprise digitization.

Scenario 1: Start-up companies need information-based office and business automation. They can quickly build the required business systems, such as internal office systems and financial settlement systems, by deploying MASA Stack. MASA Stack can directly connect to MASA Cloud or third-party software application systems purchased on the market, such as financial software like Kingdee and Yonyou. This enables companies to quickly meet their IT software needs while ensuring the security of the entire system's operation and maintenance.

Scenario 2: Companies are trying to adjust to new business needs and require new business systems to quickly validate the feasibility of the new business. By deploying or using MASA Stack in advance, they can quickly integrate project management systems, authentication systems, and configuration centers to enable the new business system to run in a short period of time.

### Version Planning

Version 2.0 will add more product suites, so stay tuned.
