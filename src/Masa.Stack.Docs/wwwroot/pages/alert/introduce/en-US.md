# Product Introduction

## What is MASA.Alert?

MASA.Alert is a complementary product that mainly provides alarm rules and related indicators. It needs to be combined with the basic functions of several products to play its value, such as the fault diagnosis console as the monitoring data source, the scheduling center as the scheduling cycle control, and the message center as the channel for sending messages. MASA Stack will reuse basic functions as much as possible instead of repetitive work, so deploying it alone will lose its meaning. Only by combining it with other products can the maximum value of the alarm center be realized.
