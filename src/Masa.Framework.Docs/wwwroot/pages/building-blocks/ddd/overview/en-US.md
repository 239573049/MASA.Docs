# Domain-Driven Design - Overview

What is [Domain-Driven Design](https://blogs.masastack.com/2022/02/11/masa/framework/design/2.MASA%20Framework%20-%20DDD%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%EF%BC%881%EF%BC%89/)?

MASA Framework provides infrastructure to make domain-driven development easier to implement. Through DDD, we can focus on core business concepts and design high-quality software models that control business complexity and solve the problem of software being difficult to understand and evolve.

Common technical concepts and patterns in DDD include:

* [Domain Model](/framework/building-blocks/ddd/domain-model)
* [Repository](/framework/building-blocks/ddd/repository)
* [Domain Service](/framework/building-blocks/ddd/domain-service)

## Advantages

What are the advantages of using DDD?

* Clear and standardized design
* Facilitates transmission and inheritance
* Helps teams establish good communication
* Assists in rigorous system architecture
* Improves team design capabilities

## Conclusion

`DDD` is not a silver bullet and may not be suitable for all scenarios. The following situations may not be suitable for using `DDD`:

* Simple projects: introducing `DDD` will add too much complexity.
* Projects with time and budget constraints: using `DDD` will require a lot of time and effort to analyze business requirements and design models.
* Inadequate personnel capabilities: developers need to have strong business knowledge and design skills.
* Technical limitations: some technical environments may be difficult to support the complexity required by `DDD`.
