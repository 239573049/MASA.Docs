# Data - Overview

The `MASA Framework` is designed to be database-agnostic and currently supports the following Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks:

## Best Practices

* [`Entity Framework Core`](/framework/building-blocks/data/orm-efcore)

## Other

* [Connection Strings](/framework/building-blocks/data/connection-strings)
* [Data Filtering](/framework/building-blocks/data/data-filter)
* [Global Configuration](/framework/building-blocks/data/global-configuration)

## Contributions

If the current ORM framework does not meet your needs or if there is a better ORM framework available, you can submit an issue to us. If you have created a new ORM provider and believe it would be useful to other developers, you can consider contributing to the `MASA Framework`.
