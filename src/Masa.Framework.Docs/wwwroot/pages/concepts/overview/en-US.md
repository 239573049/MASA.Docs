Overview

The new .NET modern application development provides a distributed application runtime based on Dapr cloud-native best practices, enabling fast implementation of modern application development such as distributed, microservices, DDD, and SaaS.

Modern Application

It is a combination of modern technology, system architecture, software delivery practices, and operational processes that can deliver value faster, more frequently, more consistently, and more securely, ultimately allowing us to focus on business and make change simpler.

Mecha

A universal, highly configurable, and reusable component that provides distributed primitives as ready-made capabilities. Our inspiration comes from Mecha, and we have distilled the following points:

One-stop Shop

Provides a one-stop shop experience from development to operation.

Application Architecture

Not only can it be used as a monolithic application, but it can also be used for distributed applications or to build modern applications.

Follow .NET Native Design

No magic changes, reducing learning costs.

Observability

By collecting logs, metrics, and Dapr observability capabilities, it provides a deep understanding of the application, making it easy to diagnose .NET, such as tracing and metrics.

Multi-Environment

Through environment isolation, the project only needs to be deployed once.

Orchestration and Coordination Capabilities

Business processes can be dynamically orchestrated and coordinated (Plan).## MASA Framework Terminology and Definitions
