# Quick Start - Overview

`MASA Framework` is a backend framework based on `.Net6.0`, which can be used to develop web applications, WPF projects, and console projects. It is structured into three parts:

* BuildingBlocks: provides interface standards and the ability to connect different building blocks, reducing coupling while ensuring the main logic
* Contrib: provides the best practice implementation based on the interface standards of building blocks, which can be replaced
* Utils: a common class library that provides underlying common capabilities, which can be used by `BuildingBlocks` and `Contrib`
